Our good friend and academic mentor Fried Augenbroe passed away on Friday, May 14th surrounded by his three daughters and loving wife. 
 
Fried was a thought leader in the building science area. He is known to many of us for a range of in-depth contributions such as his work on simulation tool development including the BFEP program; the EU COMBINE project on interoperability and the use of computer tools in the AEC industry; his pioneering work on uncertainty analysis and risk analysis; his unique contribution on the use of simulation to inform design decisions; his work on normative energy calculations (NEN2916 and ISO-CEN 13790); work on project planning, and others. At GeorgiaTech he was director of the High Performance Building laboratory, guiding the work of a large number of MSc and PhD students. His work was recognized by the community through a number of awards, such as the JOULE Researcher of the Year award from the EU-CEC in 1995, IBPSA-USA Lifetime Achievement Award 2008, and IBPSA Distinguished Achievement Award 2015. 
 
Apart from his deep knowledge on many subjects, Fried was wonderful - known for his cunning sense of humor, great at motivating and encouraging his students and colleagues, and a true friend.
